# AI Agents - Reply Student Tech Clash
This repository contains the work of my team and me. **We developed an AI agent based on the GPT model, capable of answering questions about the Polimi's website**. 

The agent retrieves data from polimi.it and uses it to deliver complete and reliable information, along with the specific url the piece of information was found on. 

Check out the [final presentation](passione.pdf) along with the [challenge presentation](docs/reply-presentation.pdf) and the [case study](docs/case-study.pdf).
